# SQL-Revision
## A short note for revising the SQL.

SQL stands for “structured query language”. It is a language used to query,
analyze, and manipulate data from databases. Today, SQL is one of the most
widely used tools in data.


Title: SELECT and WHERE for Filtering and Selection in SQL

Introduction:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful language used for managing and manipulating data in relational database management systems. Two essential components of SQL, SELECT and WHERE, are fundamental for filtering and selecting data. In this lesson, we will explore how to effectively use SELECT and WHERE clauses to retrieve specific information from a database.

I. The SELECT Statement:
The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. Its basic syntax is as follows:
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```
1. Retrieve All Columns:
   - To retrieve all columns from a table, use an asterisk (*) in the SELECT statement:
   ```
   SELECT *
   FROM table_name;
   ```

2. Retrieve Specific Columns:
   - Specify the columns you want to retrieve by listing their names after the SELECT keyword:
   ```
   SELECT column1, column2
   FROM table_name;
   ```

II. The WHERE Clause:
The WHERE clause is used to filter data based on specific conditions. It allows us to retrieve only the rows that meet certain criteria. The basic syntax is as follows:
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

1. Filtering Rows:
   - Use comparison operators (=, <, >, <=, >=, <>) to compare column values with specific values.
   ```
   SELECT column1, column2
   FROM table_name
   WHERE column_name = value;
   ```

2. Combining Conditions:
   - Use logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine multiple conditions for more complex filtering.
   ```
   SELECT column1, column2
   FROM table_name
   WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
   ```

3. Pattern Matching:
   - The WHERE clause can employ pattern matching with the LIKE operator and wildcard characters (% and _).
   ```
   SELECT column1, column2
   FROM table_name
   WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern';
   ```

4. NULL Values:
   - Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL to filter rows with NULL values in a specific column.
   ```
   SELECT column1, column2
   FROM table_name
   WHERE column_name IS NULL;
   ```

Conclusion:
In SQL, the SELECT and WHERE clauses are indispensable tools for filtering and selecting specific data from a database. By using these concepts effectively, you can extract meaningful information and perform complex queries. Understanding how to construct SELECT statements and utilize the WHERE clause empowers you to retrieve precise results tailored to your requirements.

Remember to practice and experiment with SQL queries to enhance your proficiency.
